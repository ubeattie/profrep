# Using profrep

This vignette documents the most common use cases and patterns for the profrep package.

## Introduction

To use profrep, you will have to start with lab work! As described on the home page, one of the most common measurements that stress physiologists take is blood samples for corticosterone quantification during a stress response.

## Basic Use: From a CSV

First, we will install the package from CRAN:

```{r setup}
library(profrep)
```
