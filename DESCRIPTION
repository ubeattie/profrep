Description: Calculates profile repeatability for replicate stress response curves, 
  or similar time-series data. Profile repeatability is an individual repeatability metric 
  that uses the variances at each timepoint, the maximum variance, the number of crossings 
  (lines that cross over each other), and the number of replicates to compute the 
  repeatability score. For more information see: Reed et al., 2019, Gen. Comp. Endocrinol (270).
