This code is for the profrep R package to calculate individual profile repeatability (Reed et al., 2019) <!-- example: one-liner -->


Things to include in the readme:
- one liner explaining the purpose of the package
- short description of the goals of the package (1-2 paragraphs)
- theory: a 2-4 paragraph description of the theory behind the code (purpose, math, etc)

## Package Goals

<!-- put the short description here -->

## Theory

<!-- put the theory here -->

## Citations

<!-- put any citations in the theory here -->

<!-- don't worry about what is below this line -->

## Demo

## Further Informtion

## Development

To run `R CMD check`: `devtools::check()`

To run test suite: `devtools::test()`

To run a single file of tests: `testthat::test_file("tests/testthat/<test_file_name>.R")

To update package documentation: `devtools::document()`

## Actions

This repo uses GitHub Actions to maintain the code base. There are actions to:

- Run the `R CMD check` on the three major operating systems for the current and former R version
- Build the project website with `pkgdown`
